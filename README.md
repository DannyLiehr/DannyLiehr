- Hi, I’m Danny. I use he pronouns. <br/>`Ex: Danny likes to make [his] own small apps for [himself].` <br/>You can totally call me Dee if you'd like.
- I’m interested in Python, PHP, Javascript, and databases.
- I’m currently learning about C++ and modifying my own computer tower.
- You can reach me at my email.
- I tend to post various projects here, and tinker around with repl.it.

The gaps in my repositories is from making things and not placing them up on Github.

I'm 26 years old, and when I'm not coding, I'm drawing. I have gone to get an education for both of these things! I'm known primarily for my art in the Gorillaz community. I want to be known for making little games, too.
