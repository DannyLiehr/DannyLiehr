Hi, I’m Danny. You can totally call me Dee if you'd like. I’m interested in Python, PHP, Javascript, and databases. Currently a Jr. Full Stack Developer at Mail Shark. I'm 28 years old, and when I'm not coding, I'm drawing. I have gone to get an education for both of these things! I'm known primarily for my art in the Gorillaz community. I want to be known for making little games, too.

I used to make mods for _Don't Starve_ and _Don't Starve Together_, but the latter has changed drastically since I last played regularly.

My largest project is not listed here because it's not open source. `www.writelighthouse.com`. A journal app for people who experience structural dissociation (typically present in dissociative disorders). Still a big work-in-progress.

Outside of work, my interests include listening to/drawing Gorillaz, watching Jerma, and writing about my experiences with mental health. I like to play Zelda games, The Sims 4, Minecraft, Don't Starve, and very occasionally Team Fortress 2 (MvM Scout main).
