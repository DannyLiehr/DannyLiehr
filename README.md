## Contribution Gaps
I have gaps in my contributions when I'm working on private software that does not need a repository.

## Lighthouse
[Lighthouse](https://www.writelighthouse.com) is my most significant passion project to date. 
It's a journal app for people who experience structural dissociation (typically present in dissociative disorders). Still a big work-in-progress. But I will say that the project is built on ExpressJS, vanilla javascript, and Postgres. 

If you create an account and go to the settings page, you'll see where I've begun to build an API!
