Hi, I’m Danny. You can totally call me Dee if you'd like. I’m interested in Python, PHP, Javascript, and databases. Currently a Jr. Full Stack Developer at Mail Shark. I'm 28 years old, and when I'm not coding, I'm drawing. I have gone to get an education for both of these things! I'm known primarily for my art in the Gorillaz community. I want to be known for making little games, too.

I used to make mods for _Don't Starve_ and _Don't Starve Together_, but the latter has changed drastically since I last played regularly. Still, those mods are posted here as well. Willoughby is not maintained anymore because that mod has become kind of redundant after the gardening update. I've been modding 2-D into _Don't Starve: Shipwrecked_, but I need to get back into the headspace to resume it.

My largest project is not listed here because it's not open source. `www.writelighthouse.com`. A journal app for people who experience structural dissociation (typically present in dissociative disorders). Still a big work-in-progress.

Outside of work, my interests include listening to/drawing Gorillaz, watching Jerma, and writing about my experiences with mental health. I like to play Zelda games, The Sims 4, Minecraft, Don't Starve, and very occasionally Team Fortress 2 (MvM Scout main).
